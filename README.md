## What is CryptoBot?
CryptoBot is the name of an initiative to provide a user-friendly and secure interface for users to utilize automated trading algorithms for various cryptocurrencies.  Our current data-flow utilizes several python programs to populate databases with trading information.  The DataRelayService is a layer of abstraction between our user-interfaces and our databases.  Its purpose is to simplify transfer of data between multiple user-interfaces by keeping our queries in one location.  This allows us to only make changes to the DataRelayService should our underlying database architecture change at any point instead of modifying each individual user-interface.  Our DataRelayService then provides information to our user-interfaces, so that our users can see pertinent information for our trading algorithms.

## How did we use Agile?
Our team used Scrum, through Axosoft, and met after nearly every class for our "daily" Scrum standup. Once every 2 weeks we met in order to plan our next sprint, as well as review our previous sprint and retrospect on how we can improve our future efforts. We broke up our project into 4 two-week sprints. 

| Sprints       | Focus                   | Accomplished |
| ------------- |:----------------------: |:------------:|
| Sprint 1      | Setup Servers, Website  |     Yes      |
| Sprint 2      | Web Service and Scrape  |     Yes      |
| Sprint 3      | Switch to Node, make DB |     Yes      |
| Sprint 4      | Bitcoin Price Algorithms|     No       |
