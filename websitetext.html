CryptoBot—Safe on the market, Safe in your pocket

Do you have CryptoCraze but you don’t want to lose it all? Everyone knows that it’s a hot market out there, new millionares are made every day. But what about when the bubble breaks? Are you at risk to lose it all?
Have no fear! With CryptoBot, you can sleep safe at night. Your coins are kept safe with our state-of-the-art cold storage, while Crypto Chris (insert adorable crypto bot logo, our mascot “Chris”), our lovable Crypto Bot mascot will trade for you passively during the day. Chris comes with three default settings: “Agressive”, “Lazy” and “Safe”. 
What is CryptoBot?

CryptoBot is one-place stop for your Crypto-investment needs. We watch the market, so you don’t have to!

Because we are watching all the time, your Bitcoins are safe with us. This means they are safe on the market, and safe in your pocket (trademark).  (insert “did you know blah blah blah money was stolen from bitcoins in 2017?)

What are Aggressive, Lazy, and Safe trading modes?

When Chris is trading in “Aggressive mode”, he will go in the for kill! Expect fantastic great results on a good week (we had some customers see over 10000% increase in their gains!), and…pretty dismal results on a bad week. Chris will stop trading if he senses the market is crashing, so do not worry, your money is safe!. However, Chris in “Bull Mode” is unstoppable when the market is on the rise, and he will quit trading when things get bad!
This mode is only recommended for advanced traders who know what they’re doing—high risk== high reward.

What about Lazy, and Safe trading modes?
When Chris is being “lazy”, he’s not being lazy, per se. He’s just gonna hang around and wait until it’s a good time to buy and a good time to sell…even if it takes a couple of weeks…or months. Chris is pretty slow when he’s being lazy, so don’t expect a lot of results really quickly. However, if you are patient and willing to wait for the right moment, the payouts can be huge! 
Ok, I don’t like high-risk, and I don’t like waiting. What about Safe mode?

As you’ve probably figured out by now, Safe Mode is pretty safe. In fact, this is the mode in which you’re actually guaranteed a return on your investment. When Chris is in Safe mode, he just picks safe reliable coins like Bitcoin, and just sails away…to a beautiful foreign island, where he can tan on the beach and drink piña coladas all day. You probably won’t get rich trading in Safe Mode, but it is a good way to get started with trading, as well as diversify your portfolio. 

What if I want to make my own trades?
 If you make your own trades, Chris can’t help you! (show a very adorable confused chris looking at a stock chart)
